# `mir_eval` as a web service

This repository contains a proof-of-concept which demonstrates how `mir_eval` can be used as a web service.
It will not be kept up-to-date with respect to the latest `mir_eval`, so we recommend you use `mir_eval` directly instead.
Information about installing and using `mir_eval` can be found in the [documentation](https://craffel.github.io/mir_eval/).
An example instance of this web service is running [here](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/mir_eval).
